abstract: "This paper presents the motivation and design of MTP, a new offload-friendly message transport protocol. Existing transport protocols like TCP, MPTCP, and UDP/Quic all have key limitations when used in a network that may potentially offload computation from end-servers into NICs, switches, and other network devices. To enable important new in-network computing use cases and correct congestion control in the face of ever changing network paths and application replicas, MTP introduces a new message transport protocol design and pathlet congestion control, a new approach where end-hosts explicitly communicate messaging information to network devices and network devices explicitly communicate network path and congestion information back to end-hosts."
