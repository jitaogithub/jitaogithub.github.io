abstract = {The sharing of clusters with various on-NIC offloads by high-level entities (users, containers, etc.) has become increasingly common. Performance isolation across these entities is desired because the offloads can become bottlenecks due to the limited capacity of hardware. However, the existing works that provide scheduling and resource management to NIC offloads all require customization of the NIC or offloads, while commodity off-the-shelf NICs and offloads with proprietary implementation have been widely deployed in datacenters. This paper presents Yama, the first solution to enable per-entity isolation in the sharing of such black-box NIC offloads. Yama provides a generic framework that captures a common abstraction to the operation of most offloads, which allows operators to incorporate existing offloads. The framework proactively probes for the performance of the offloads with auxiliary workload and enforces isolation at the initiator side. Yama also accommodates chained offloads. Our evaluation shows that 1) Yama achieves per-entity max-min fairness for various types of offloads and in complicated offload chaining scenarios; 2) Yama quickly converges to changes in equilibrium and 3) Yama adds negligible overhead to application workload.},
