I am a fifth-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/). I am broadly interested in datacenter networks, with a focus on the opportunities and problems in applying in-network computing to real-world systems. My recent research focuses on the transport-layer problems, such as providing reliable delivery and congestion control, for in-network computing. I have also interned at Google and Microsoft, working on projects that involve hardware offloading of transport (e.g., RDMA), congestion control and 5G vRAN. 

**I am looking for a full-time industry job that starts in fall 2024.**
