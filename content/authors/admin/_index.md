I am currently a senior software engineer at Microsoft with a focus on [MANA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-mana-overview). I received my PhD in Computer Science from [UT Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) in August 2024. I was advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/). I am broadly interested in intra- and inter-datacenter networks. My PhD research discovered opportunities and tackled problems in applying in-network computing to real-world systems. I have also interned at Google and Microsoft, working on projects that covered hardware transport offloading, congestion control and 5G vRAN. 

**I am actively looking for collaboration with the academia. Email me.**
